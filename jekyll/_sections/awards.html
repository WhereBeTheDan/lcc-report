    text: 'We expected the Chamber to provide an excellent opportunity for us to network with other Loudoun County businesses, which it has. We did not expect the Chamber to respond as quickly and effectively as it did when it learned that one of its members was being threatened. The Chamber hosted a rally at the brewery inviting residents and other local business owners to show their support. It was an amazing night and we are grateful for the ongoing support of the Chamber.'
