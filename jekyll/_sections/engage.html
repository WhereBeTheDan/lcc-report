    text: 'Never before have I seen an organization so focused on helping businesses grow. The Chamber named me Home Business of the Year and I wasn&rsquo;t even a member yet! They promote their members and award winners in every way possible. My business has almost doubled since winning and then joining. My only regret is not joining sooner!'

    text: 'The Loudoun Chamber is where it all starts. I have made a number of connections that have helped me grow my business by over 25% in the last year, and it all started with the Chamber. Every single connection I have has come either directly or indirectly from the Loudoun Chamber. To be clear, I don&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;most&rdquo; or &ldquo;a lot.&rdquo; I mean every single one. It is integral to my business.'
