        <h2 class="sub-title">Dear Fellow Chamber Members</h2>

        <p>Happy 2016!</p>

        <p>I am very honored and humbled to have been afforded the opportunity to take on the role of Chairman of the Board of the Loudoun County Chamber of Commerce for 2015.</p>

        <p>I am extremely proud of the Chamber’s larger accomplishments this year:</p>

        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>The Chamber’s Policy Committee, through its PolicyMaker Series and Loudoun BizVotes, successfully educated our members and many other Loudoun County residents, bringing clarity to the fog of campaign rhetoric.</li>
            <li>Following a huge membership drive in 2014, a special emphasis on new member retention by our Membership Chairman, Mitch Sproul, has successfully kept our total membership value steady for the past two years.</li>
            <li>In its first full year of existence, the Loudoun Chamber Foundation will make two series of grants to assist local nonprofits in their efforts that coincide with the Chamber’s Strategic Plan.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For the past few years, I have been working closely with our incoming 2016 Chairman, Greg Jay. He is a longtime resident and businessman in Loudoun County, and has become a good friend of mine. I am confident that the Chamber is now in great hands.</p> 

        <p>Thank you for all for Being a Part of It!, and thank you again for granting me the privilege of leading the Loudoun County Chamber of Commerce for the last year.</p>
